I am a Software Engineer at Delphi Digital (formerly @ Zappos). My hobbies include exercising, video games, and baking. Up until recently my exercise regimen was almost entirely lifting and recreational boxing, but due to _unprecedented times_ I got heavily into running. I ran my first (and thirteenth) half-marathon in 2020.

While I enjoy baking  I'm really only competent at making chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cake. I've dabbled in making my own pizza dough this summer but have yet to produce anything of note.  I'm in the process of trying wings at every major place known for wings in the area.  It's a long list.  I've had limited success grilling and baking wings at home, but have yet to find wing meat that is on par with what the local restaurants serve.
