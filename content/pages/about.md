I am a Software Engineer at [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com). My hobbies include exercising, video games, and baking. I'm currently training a lot of grappling and running in between the inevitable injuries.  I've placed second in my age division in a handful of local races but a 1st place continues to elude me.

While I enjoy baking  I'm really only competent at making chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cake. I've dabbled in making my own pizza dough but have yet to produce anything of note.  I'm in the process of trying wings at every major place known for wings in the area.  It's a long list.  I've had limited success grilling and baking wings at home, but have yet to find wing meat that is on par with what the local restaurants serve.
