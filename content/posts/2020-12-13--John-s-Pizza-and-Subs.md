## Location & Price

This pizza was from the [Campbell Blvd](https://www.google.com/maps/place/680+Campbell+Blvd,+Buffalo,+NY+14228/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89d3713d0eddb03b:0x59f73ab6ca6a98b9?sa=X&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwibutbIvsztAhXImVkKHdZhAK0Q8gEwAHoECAUQAQ) location.  The Niagara Falls Blvd location has similar quality from what I remember (it's been a couple years).  I have not been to the other locations.

The large cheese and pepperoni pie came to $19.54 before tax.

They have online ordering [through their website](https://www.johnspizzaandsubs.com/) as well as through the [Slice app](https://slicelife.com/).  This pizza was ordered online and picked up for takeout.

## First Impressions

Out of the box, the pie doesn't look like much.  Classic Buffalo cup and char pepperoni.  Not too heavy on the toppings.  Looks a bit heavy on the cheese.  However, that all changes after the first bite.

## The Taste

The sauce has a great flavor to it, a little on the sweeter side. Combined with the one-two punch of crispy but not burnt crust and cup and char pepperoni, the sauce brings it home.  The slice had a bit of seasoning on it to add extra flavor to the sauce as well.

While it may not be the most photogenic pie, it was a great pizza.  I will definitely be adding them into my standard rotation as a good representation of buffalo pizza.
