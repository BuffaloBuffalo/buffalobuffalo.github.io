## Location & Price

This pizza was from the [Carbone's Pizza & Sub's](http://www.carbonespizza.com/) [Lovejoy location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carbone's+Pizza/@42.889979,-78.806538,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5fbb8cfdd14d6559?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC0d3IkIPuAhUywlkKHcXSCesQ_BIwE3oECB8QBQ).  I've been to the South Park location one other time and they had similar quality.

The large cheese and pepperoni pie came to $18.25 before tax, and clocks in at a Buffalo standard 16" in diameter.

They have online ordering through [Slice](https://slicelife.com/restaurants/ny/buffalo/14206/carbone-s-pizzeria-buffalo/menu).  This pizza was ordered online and picked up for takeout.  This was the recently introduced sweet sauce variant of their classic sauce.

## First Impressions

This is a good looking pie in the box.  The pepperoni has a slight cup to it, but I wouldn't consider it the full buffalo cup and char.  The bottom is slightly charred, but not burnt.

## The Taste

This pizza is incredible.  Granted, I'm a bit of a sucker for sweet sauce pizza, but it checks all the boxes I'm looking for.  Great tasting sauce, but not so much of it to be messy.  The crust has enough heft to it to be easily eaten one handed without being messy.  The crust isn't overly chewy either. However, two of the slices did have the cheese slide off entirely about halfway into the slice.

## The Wings

I also picked up wings this time. These were "On the Pit" wings cooked extra crispy with honey bbq sauce.  I'm normally pretty cagey on pizzeria wings.  Pizzeria wings have a tendency to be undercooked and soggy since they just get turned out at a fast pace and then steam inside a box while waiting to be picked up.  On the pit style wings don't exhibit these problems; asking for extra crispy doesn't hurt.  These were tasty and still had a good level of crispiness to them even after the 20 minute drive home.

## Conclusion

Both the pizza and wings today were excellent.  I ate a full four of the eight slices in one sitting.  I look forward to trying out their other On the Pit wing flavors, as they have demonstrated that they are capable of being a top tier pizzeria wing.  Their sweet sauce pizza is the closest I've came in finding an alternative to the holy grail Teso's Pizzeria sweet sauce (closed for Tax Evasion in the aughts).  I only wish they were a bit closer to me, otherwise they would be much closer to an everyday choice.
